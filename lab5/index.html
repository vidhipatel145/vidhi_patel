        <h2>The Trouble with Bears</h2>
        <p>By Evan Wild</p>
        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. 
          Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, *The Jungle Book*.
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Bear</h3>
        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties â€” large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) 
          from another species.
        </p>

              <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <h3>Habitats and Eating Habits</h3>
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. In general, they will hunt for food themselves in woodland 
          or rivers but, at a push, they will track down their sustenance from farms or country houses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban creatures if necessary but prefer to scavenge 
          from readily available urban food outlets.

        <h3>Mating Rituals</h3>
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest of their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor 
          by making their dwelling look attractive.

              Oh, I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace!
